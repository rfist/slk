// reconnectClient is the entire client surface the reconnect path is
// allowed to touch, and the narrowness is the point.
//
// What used to live here was an interface with GetHistorySince,
// GetReplies and ListThreadSubscriptions on it, driving a sweep over
// every channel slk had ever cached plus the workspace's whole
// thread-subscription list. Measured over one ~3-minute session on a
// 105-channel workspace:
//
//	per-channel conversations.history calls:  288
//	  returned 0 messages:                    250  (86%)
//	channel phase:        total_msgs=0   dur_ms=2711
//	subscription phase:   subs=1000      dur_ms=132248
//	ListThreadSubscriptions: hit hard cap 1000, stopping   (x4)
//
// and it ran from OnConnect, which fires on first connect and on every
// reconnect — so every laptop sleep, wifi change and VPN flap replayed
// all of it. One method is what "O(1) reconnect" means in code;
// TestReconnect_ClientSurfaceCannotEnumerate fails if it grows.

	// GetUnreadCounts is client.counts: one request that returns
	// unread state for every conversation in the workspace.

// reconnectSync is slk's catch-up after the WebSocket comes back.
//
// It exists because the socket does not replay what was missed.
// Measured 2026-08-01 on a real two-workspace setup: after a
// 90-second outage with a message posted and marked unread from
// another client, the reconnected socket delivered ~160
// presence_change events and nothing else — no message, no
// channel_marked. slk's OnConnect never called client.counts (it is
// boot-only), which is exactly why that unread never appeared. So this
// is a user-visible fix as well as a fingerprint change.
//
// Three steps, and the cost of all three is independent of workspace
// size:
//
//  1. client.counts — one request, unread state for everything.
//  2. Mark every other channel stale, so it revalidates when opened.
//  3. Refresh the channel actually on screen, through the same path a
//     channel switch uses.
//
// Thread subscriptions are NOT one of the steps. They rejoined the
// reconnect path later, but at the handler level (syncOnReconnect's
// ensureThreadSubs kick) with their own 30-minute throttle — one
// paginated sweep per window, not the unbounded per-reconnect phase
// measured above.
