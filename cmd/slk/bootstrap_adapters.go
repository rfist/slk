package main

// bootstrap_adapters.go wires slk's concrete clients onto
// internal/bootstrap's interfaces.
//
// It is a separate file from main.go for a reason that outlives the
// task that created it: internal/bootstrap deliberately does not import
// internal/slack (see that package's comment on import direction), so
// every mismatch between the two shows up here as a small named type.
// Buried in main.go those types would read as noise; gathered here they
// read as the list of translations the import rule costs, and each one
// can carry the reason it is not a pass-through.
//
// Everything in this file is deliberately trivial. Where an adapter
// does anything at all beyond forwarding — boundedMessageVersions and
// rawMessages — that is where the decisions are, and both are written
// as free functions taking narrow interfaces so a test can observe
// them without a live Slack connection or a live workspace.
