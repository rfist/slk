	// See that function for the full rationale.

	// There is deliberately no workspace-wide user fetch here.
	//
	// A users.list sweep used to run in the background at this point,
	// paginating the entire directory — ~50 pages on a 10k-user
	// workspace — to fill UserNames, UserNamesByHandle, BotUserIDs and
	// the users cache. The official web client issues users.list zero
	// times across all 8 captures, and it is the clearest single
	// "scraping" signal slk emitted. Four sources cover the same
	// ground without it:
	//
	//   - the cache seed above (db.ListUsers), which holds everyone
	//     slk has ever resolved on this workspace;
	//   - applyBootUsers, from conversations.view's users array — the
	//     authors of the messages about to be rendered;
	//   - edge.UsersInfo revalidation inside bootstrap.Run, which
	//     refreshes those records by version;
	//   - resolveUser, which fetches a single users.info on a miss and
	//     writes it to the cache, so each unknown user costs one call
	//     once rather than the whole directory every boot.
	//
	// The visible difference is that a name slk has never seen renders
	// as its user ID for the moment before resolveUser answers, rather
	// than for the (much longer) moment before the sweep finished.

	// The sidebar comes from users.conversations, with client.userBoot
	// as a fallback -- in that order, and the order was measured.
	//
	// userBoot cannot be the primary source. On a real 218-channel
	// workspace its channels[] carried 67 of them; on another, 60 of
	// 71. It is evidently not the complete joined-conversation list,
	// and preferring it silently drops channels from the sidebar,
	// which is a worse failure than the one this fixes because nobody
	// notices a channel that is merely absent.
	//
	// But users.conversations must not be FATAL either. On the
	// Enterprise Grid org in gammons/slk#5 it is rejected outright, and
	// treating that as fatal dropped the entire workspace: no
	// channels, no threads, no active workspace, and -- until the
