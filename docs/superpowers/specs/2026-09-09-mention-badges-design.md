# Mention Badges

Design for showing per-channel direct-mention counts in the sidebar, so an
unread channel is distinguishable from one that needs the user's attention.

## Problem

slk renders exactly one unread signal: a blue `●` on any channel whose
`has_unread` flag is set. A channel with two hundred unrelated messages and a
channel where someone typed the user's name look identical.

The official Slack client distinguishes these with a numeric badge counting
direct mentions — an explicit `@user`, or a `@here` / `@channel` / `@everyone`
broadcast. slk shows nothing.

The data to fix this is already arriving and being discarded. `client.counts`
returns `mention_count` per channel and per mpim; `GetUnreadCounts`
(`internal/slack/client.go:1027`) copies it into `UnreadInfo.Count`, which no
caller ever reads. The `channels` table declares an `unread_count` column
(`internal/cache/db.go:108`) that nothing writes and nothing selects.

## Goals

- A numeric badge on sidebar rows with unread direct mentions.
- Badge semantics matching the official client, including its DM special case.
- Badges appear as mentions arrive, not only at startup.

## Non-goals

- A mention badge on the synthetic Threads row. `client.counts` already returns
  `Threads.MentionCount` and `internal/bootstrap/bootstrap.go:162` already
  carries it, so the server half is nearly free — but the Threads row is driven
  by a separate in-memory counter (`internal/ui/sidebar/model.go:275`) rather
  than the read-state DB, so it needs its own increment path and its own tests.
  Deferred to keep this change to one coherent mechanism.
- Mention-aware navigation (a "jump to next mention" key alongside `a` / `A`).
- Mention counts in the window title or workspace rail.

## Semantics

Slack badges DMs by *message* count and channels by *mention* count. This is
not two rules requiring a client-side branch: Slack's server already encodes
both in one field. In `client.counts`, `mention_count` means "@-mentions" for
`channels`, and "all unread messages" for `ims` and `mpims`. Consuming that
single field uniformly reproduces Slack's behaviour exactly.

**This paragraph is the design's load-bearing assumption and it is unverified.**
See Risks below: no capture in this repo proves what `ims` carries. Every
statement of these semantics — in code comments, in doc comments, in tests —
must carry that caveat, because the three sentences above are what implementers
copy.

The local-increment path (below) must therefore branch on conversation type to
stay consistent with the server value it will later be overwritten by.

### Conversation types: Slack's three kinds vs slk's five

Slack's `client.counts` has three blocks: `channels`, `mpims`, `ims`. slk's
`ChannelItem.Type` has five values: `channel`, `private`, `dm`, `group_dm`,
`app`. The mapping is not one-to-one, and the gap is load-bearing:

| slk `Type` | `client.counts` block | Local increment rule |
|---|---|---|
| `channel`, `private` | `channels` | `mention.InText` |
| `group_dm` | `mpims` | every message |
| `dm` | `ims` | every message |
| **`app`** | **`ims`** | **every message** |

`app` is the trap. `buildChannelItem` classifies an `is_im=true` conversation
as `app` when the peer is a bot and `dm` otherwise — a distinction slk invents
for sidebar grouping and Slack does not make. Both land in the `ims` block and
both get all-unread semantics. Any local rule that tests for `dm` or `group_dm`
without also testing `app` will badge app DMs from the server at boot and then
never increment them live.

### Mute

`ChannelMuted` (`internal/ui/styles/styles.go:94-100`) documents that muted
channels "never get the blue `•` indicator, even when their UnreadCount is
non-zero", and `ChannelItem.IsVisiblyUnread`
(`internal/ui/sidebar/model.go:54-61`) enforces it.

Mentions pierce mute. A muted channel stays grey and unbolded for ordinary
traffic but still badges on an explicit mention — that escape hatch is what
makes muting safe to use on a busy channel. The existing invariant is narrowed
to scope its suppression to the dot only; the comment at `styles.go:94-100` is
amended in the same commit so code and comment do not diverge.

A muted badge is *dimmed*, not suppressed. `MutedMentionBadgeStyle()` mixes the
normal badge's background toward the sidebar background, keeping the hue while
dropping the brightness — the same treatment `ChannelMuted` gives a row's
foreground. Its foreground is `SidebarText` rather than `SelectionForeground`,
because once the background has been mixed most of the way back toward the
sidebar, the colour that contrasts with it is the one that contrasts with the
sidebar. Both terms move together across themes, so this holds on light and
dark alike.

A collapsed section header dims its aggregate badge only when *every* mention
it counted came from a muted channel. One unmuted channel holding a mention
makes the header shout as loudly as that row would.

## Approach

Server counts are authoritative; local detection fills the gap between
refreshes.

`client.counts` is called only at boot
(`cmd/slk/bootstrap_adapters.go:100`) and on reconnect
(`cmd/slk/reconnect_sync.go:129`). A session that stays connected all day would
never update a badge, so server data alone cannot satisfy the third goal.
Incoming `message` WebSocket events therefore increment the count locally.

The error term of this hybrid is what recommends it. Local detection can only
*undercount*, only on `<!subteam^…>` usergroup mentions, and the error is
erased the moment the user reads the channel or reconnects. The unread dot
still appears regardless, so no message is ever missed outright — the worst
case is a dot where Slack would have shown `1`.

The rejected alternatives:

- **Server-only.** Provably correct, but badges update only at boot and
  reconnect. Fails the liveness goal outright.
- **Local-only.** Re-implements semantics the server already computes, and
  drifts permanently with no correction path.
- **Adding a periodic `client.counts` poll.** Would also correct usergroup
  drift, at one extra API call per interval. Rejected because this codebase
  deliberately avoids chatty endpoints — `internal/slack/client.go:31-35`
  records that `conversations.list` and `users.list` are never called at all.
  Reconsider only if usergroup undercounting proves annoying in practice.

## Data model

### Storage

Add to the `channels` table, via the existing `addColumnIfMissing` migration
helper (`internal/cache/db.go:223`):

```sql
mention_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
```

Remove the dead `unread_count` column from the `CREATE TABLE` statement.
Nothing reads or writes it, and keeping two similarly-named count columns
invites a future author to pick the wrong one. Existing databases retain the
vestigial column harmlessly; no destructive migration is performed.

### Types

`cache.ReadState` and `cache.ChannelReadStateUpdate`
(`internal/cache/channels_read_state.go:11-23`) each gain a mention field.

`UpdateChannelReadState` keeps its current signature. Mention count is written
through two dedicated methods instead:

```go
func (db *DB) SetChannelMentionCount(channelID string, n int) error
func (db *DB) IncrementChannelMentionCount(channelID string) error
```

Three verbs are needed — set, increment, and leave alone — but only two are
operations. "Leave alone" is declining to call, not a parameter value. Encoding
it as one would have forced a positional argument onto
`UpdateChannelReadState`, whose four production callers are outnumbered by
roughly twenty test callers in `internal/cache/channels_read_state_test.go` and
`cmd/slk/event_handler_marked_test.go`. Those edits would be mechanical, would
change no behaviour, and would bury the real diff.

`ChannelReadStateUpdate` gains a plain `MentionCount int`. Both batch writers
are fed exclusively from `client.counts`, so batch semantics are
unconditionally "set" and need no operation field. `ReplaceWorkspaceReadState`
extends its workspace-wide reset to zero `mention_count` alongside
`has_unread`.

`IncrementChannelMentionCount` is expressed as
`mention_count = mention_count + 1` so it is atomic and cannot lose a
concurrent update.

The cost: `OnMessage` and `markChannelReadAsync` each issue two single-row
UPDATEs rather than one. Both target the same row, SQLite serialises them, and
because `MentionBadge` gates on `HasUnread` a reader landing between them
cannot observe the intermediate state.

### Transport types

`slack.UnreadInfo.Count` (`internal/slack/client.go:934`) and its restatement
`bootstrap.Unread.Count` (`internal/bootstrap/bootstrap.go:148`) currently hold
a value that is not a count of anything: `client.go:1026-1031` sets it to
`mention_count`, then floors it to `1` whenever `has_unreads` is true and
`mention_count` is `0`. Nothing reads it, so the fabrication has never mattered.

Both fields are renamed to `MentionCount` and carry the server's raw value with
no flooring. The `ims` block, which currently hardcodes `Count = 1`
(`client.go:1051-1053`), parses and forwards `mention_count` like the other two
blocks. This is a rename of a dead field rather than a behaviour change, and it
is what makes the boot and reconnect rows of the table below meaningful.

### Writes

| Trigger | Write |
|---|---|
| `client.counts` at boot → `ReplaceWorkspaceReadState` | `MentionCount` per entry; workspace-wide reset zeroes channels absent from the snapshot |
| `client.counts` on reconnect → `BatchUpdateChannelReadState` | `MentionCount` per entry |
| `*_marked` WS event → `OnChannelMarked` | `SetChannelMentionCount` from the event's `mention_count` |
| `markChannelReadAsync` — user reads a channel | `SetChannelMentionCount(id, 0)` |
| `MarkUnread` — the `u` key | `SetChannelMentionCount` from a recount of cached messages at or after the new boundary |
| Incoming `message`, mention detected | `IncrementChannelMentionCount` |
| Incoming `message`, no mention | no call |


### Mark-unread recounts rather than clearing

Marking a message unread moves the read boundary to a message the user picked
off their own screen. The first cut wrote `0` there and relied on Slack's
echoed `*_marked` event to restore the real number, reasoning that slk had not
evaluated what lay below the new boundary and should not invent a count.

Testing showed the echo carries no usable `mention_count`, so marking a direct
mention unread replaced its badge with a bare dot — destroying exactly the
signal the user was trying to preserve. This is also partial evidence on the
`*_marked` payload question in Risks below.

The count is now computed from the cache: `GetMessagesSince` returns the
main-feed messages at or after the boundary, and `countMentionsSince` counts
those that mention the user, excluding self-authored ones to match the live
path's `isSelfMessage`. That is arithmetic on data slk holds, not the guess the
original reasoning was avoiding — the messages below a boundary the user just
selected are cached by construction.

It can undercount if the user marks something unread far enough back that the
intervening messages were never fetched. `client.counts` corrects that on the
next reconnect. A failure to count leaves the previous value rather than
zeroing it, since a stale badge beats a vanished one.

### Reads

Unchanged. `GetWorkspaceReadState` selects one additional column. The sidebar's
existing `readStateReader` closure (`cmd/slk/main.go:1353`) already delivers a
`map[string]cache.ReadState` to the renderer on every build, so the new field
reaches the UI with no new plumbing.

## Mention detection

### Reuse, do not reimplement

`notify.ShouldNotify` (`internal/notify/notifier.go`) already contains the
predicate:

```go
strings.Contains(text, "<@"+ctx.CurrentUserID+">") ||
strings.Contains(text, "<!here>") ||
strings.Contains(text, "<!channel>") ||
strings.Contains(text, "<!everyone>")
```

It is embedded in a larger policy that also weighs DND, mute, keyword triggers
and the active channel. Per AGENTS.md — *extract the substrate, not the widget*
— the uniform part is "does this text mention me?"; the divergent parts are the
policies each consumer wraps around it.

Extract to a new `internal/mention` package:

```go
func InText(text, selfUserID string) bool
```

`notify.ShouldNotify` is refactored to call it, keeping its policy layer
intact. A new package rather than an exported `notify.IsMention` because
read-state code importing a package documented as "desktop notification
support" would misrepresent the dependency, and both consumers depend on the
predicate equally rather than one owning it.

`internal/mention.InText` is added to the AGENTS.md shared-code table in the
same commit, per that file's own convention.

### Increment rule

Evaluated in `rtmEventHandler.OnMessage`, immediately beside the existing
`has_unread` write at `cmd/slk/main.go:4037-4048`, so the two decisions cannot
drift apart:

```
increment when:
      author != self
  AND shouldMarkChannel               (existing thread-reply gate)
  AND activeChannelID != channelID    (existing active-channel gate)
  AND ( conversation is dm/group_dm  →  always
      | otherwise                     →  mention.InText(text, selfUserID) )
```

Three of the four clauses are already local variables at that call site.

Reusing `shouldMarkChannel` means a mention inside a non-broadcast thread reply
does not badge its parent channel. This matches Slack, where thread mentions
surface in the Threads section instead.

### Known gaps

Both self-heal on the next server refresh:

- **Usergroup mentions are not detected.** `<!subteam^S…>` requires knowing the
  user's own group memberships. `boot.Subteams.Self`
  (`internal/slack/boot/boot.go:203-215`) is deliberately typed as
  `[]json.RawMessage` because no capture with a non-empty list has ever been
  observed. Undercount only.
- **Per-channel notification prefs are not modelled.** A channel configured to
  suppress `@channel` / `@here` still increments locally. Overcount only.

## Rendering

### Predicate

A sibling to `IsVisiblyUnread`, preserving that method's documented role as the
single source of truth for its rule:

```go
func (item ChannelItem) MentionBadge(state cache.ReadState) int
```

Returns the count to display, or `0` for no badge. Unlike `IsVisiblyUnread` it
does not consult `IsMuted`. It does require `state.HasUnread`: a channel with
no unreads never badges, so a stale non-zero `mention_count` cannot outlive the
unread flag that justifies it.

The `99+` cap is applied at render time only. The database stores the true
count, so a later refresh that lowers the count below 100 shows the real
number rather than a value already clamped on the way in.

### Layout

The badge replaces the trailing dot in `buildCache`
(`internal/ui/sidebar/model.go:1331-1345`). A row shows either a dot (unread,
no mentions) or a badge (unread with mentions), never both — matching Slack and
costing no additional glyph slot in the row layout.

Counts display as `99+` above 99, as Slack's do, bounding the badge at three
characters.

### Collapsed section headers

A collapsed section header renders an aggregate — the count of
channels-with-unreads inside it, via `IsVisiblyUnread`. That count cannot
distinguish chatter from an @-mention, which is the one distinction this
feature exists to make.

It matters because of a default: `sidebar.New()` starts `defaultChannelsSection`
and `defaultAppsSection` collapsed in config mode, so the channel firehose — the
place a mention is most easily lost — is exactly where the badge is invisible.
Slack-sections mode is unaffected, since `collapseByID` starts nil and nothing
is collapsed; DMs default expanded on both paths.

The header therefore carries **two** independent figures, never merged:

```
 ▸ Channels •5 ▐3▌
```

- `•5` — five channels in this section have unreads. Unchanged meaning,
  unchanged glyph, still `IsVisiblyUnread`.
- `▐3▌` — three unread direct mentions across the section, summed from
  `MentionBadge`. Rendered with `MentionBadgeStyle()`, capped at `99+`, and
  omitted entirely at zero.

Summing mention counts rather than counting mentioned channels is deliberate:
at row level the badge answers "how many times was I named here", and a section
header that answered a different question with the same glyph would teach the
user the wrong thing.

Because `MentionBadge` ignores mute, a muted channel contributes to the
mention figure but not to the unread figure. That asymmetry is the same one
the rows already show, and it is the point: muting silences chatter, not
someone naming you.

### Width budget

`model.go:1375-1383` computes `maxNameLen` from a hardcoded budget of
`cursor(2) + prefix(3) + name + space(1) + dot(2) = name + 8`, assuming
worst-case two-column rendering for ambiguous-width glyphs.

That computation is already inside the per-item loop, so it can account for the
current row's actual badge width rather than a global worst case. Rows without
mentions keep exactly today's name width; only badged rows surrender columns.
The bare `8` becomes a named constant derived from the badge's maximum width —
a magic number that already required a five-line comment to justify.

### Style

The theme's highlight pair is `SelectionBackground` / `SelectionForeground`,
which `Apply()` guarantees is populated and contrast-safe on every theme,
deriving `Primary`-on-`Background` when a theme omits it.

```go
func MentionBadgeStyle() lipgloss.Style {
    return lipgloss.NewStyle().
        Background(SelectionBackground).
        Foreground(SelectionForeground)
}
```

A function, not a package var, because `UnreadBadge` demonstrates the failure
mode: it is defined twice, once as an init-time var (`styles.go:106-109`) and
again inside `buildStyles()` (`:457-458`). Every var-shaped style must be
remembered in both places, and the init-time copy reads `Selection*` while it
is still nil (those two are declared without initializers at `:36-37`).
`Apply()` populates them at `:348-361` before calling `buildStyles()` at
`:395`, so the `buildStyles` copy would be correct — but a function has a
single definition and cannot go stale by omission at all. This is why
`SelectionStyle()` and `SearchHighlightStyle()`
(`internal/ui/styles/styles.go:508-521`) are already functions.

`UnreadBadge` is **kept**. It is live: `internal/ui/statusbar/model.go:250`
renders the status bar's " N unread " badge with it. An earlier draft of this
document called it unused and proposed deleting it; that was wrong, and
deleting it would break the build.

### Recorded, out of scope: UnreadBadge contrast

`UnreadBadge` hardcodes `Foreground(lipgloss.Color("#FFFFFF"))` over
`Background(Error)` (`styles.go:457-458`). On a theme whose `Error` is pale,
white-on-error is unreadable. `WorkspaceActive` (`:443-445`) and `StatusMode`
(`:469-470`) hardcode the same literal white over `Primary`.

This is a pre-existing defect in the status bar and workspace rail, not
something this feature introduces or touches. Per AGENTS.md — *found a bug
while refactoring? Record it, annotate it, raise it separately* — it is noted
here and left alone. The mention badge avoids the whole class by using the
theme's own contrast-guaranteed `Selection*` pair.

### Inline ANSI

The badge emits a background color mid-row, so it must participate in the
existing `ReapplyBgAfterResets` handling at `model.go:1400-1432` exactly as the
styled cursor, prefix and dot glyphs already do.

## Testing

Plain `testing.T`, stdlib only, white-box, per repo convention.

- **`internal/mention`** — table test: self-mention; each broadcast form; a
  `<@OTHERUSER>` non-match; a substring near-miss (`<@U123ABC>` when self is
  `U123`) proving the angle bracket is required; empty self ID.
- **`internal/notify`** — the existing `ShouldNotify` tests must pass unchanged.
  That is the regression proof the extraction preserved behaviour.
- **`internal/cache`** — `SetChannelMentionCount` writes;
  `IncrementChannelMentionCount` accumulates across repeated calls and starts
  from zero on a fresh row; neither disturbs `last_read_ts` or `has_unread`.
  `ReplaceWorkspaceReadState` zeroes `mention_count` for channels absent from
  the snapshot. Migration adds the column to a pre-existing database, mirroring
  the column-type assertion at `internal/cache/db_test.go:51-88`.
- **`cmd/slk`** — `OnMessage` increments for a DM and for a channel mention;
  does *not* increment for a self-authored message, a non-mention, a plain
  thread reply, or the active channel. `OnChannelMarked` sets the count from the
  event payload. Extends the existing `event_handler_marked_test.go` pattern.
- **`internal/ui/sidebar`** — badge replaces the dot; a muted channel badges but
  stays unbolded; the `99+` cap; the per-row width budget shrinks the name only
  on badged rows.

## Risks

**`mention_count` on `*_marked` events is unverified.** `wsChannelMarkedEvent`
(`internal/slack/events.go:193-198`) parses only `unread_count_display`, and the
fixture at `events_test.go:447` carries only that field. Real Slack payloads are
believed to include `mention_count`, but this repo has no capture proving it.

**`mention_count` on the `ims` block of `client.counts` is unverified.** The
current parser (`client.go:994-998`) omits the field for IMs, hardcoding
`Count = 1` instead. The DM semantics described above depend on Slack populating
it.

Both degrade gracefully: if the field is absent it decodes as `0`, and
decrements still work because reading a channel zeroes the count locally via
`markChannelReadAsync`. The implementation plan must capture a real payload for
each before relying on them, and fall back to a documented alternative if
either is missing.

## Out of scope, revisit later

- Threads-row mention badge (see Non-goals).
- A periodic `client.counts` poll to correct usergroup undercounting.
- Typing `boot.Subteams.Self` to enable local usergroup mention detection, which
  requires a capture with a non-empty list.

## Pre-existing bugs found during this work

Neither is caused by this feature and neither is fixed here, per AGENTS.md's
*record it, annotate it, raise it separately*. Both are recorded here so the
annotation in the code has something to point at.

### Sidebar render cache ignores theme changes

`buildCache`'s `m.cacheValid` (`internal/ui/sidebar/model.go`) is not keyed on
`styles.Version()`, so a `styles.Apply` after a `View()` returns the previous
theme's bytes verbatim. `styles.Version()` exists precisely to drive this kind
of invalidation, and the App-level `renderCache.sidebar` *is* keyed on
`themeVer` (`internal/ui/view_sidebar.go:43-47`) — which masks the inner cache's
miss rather than covering it.

Affects every sidebar glyph, not just the badge. Surfaced by the themed test
added in this work, which has to snapshot and restore global style state to
work around it.

### Section headers wrap instead of truncating

`styles.SectionHeader.Width(width - 2)` feeds a `renderRow{height: 1}`
(`internal/ui/sidebar/model.go`, header construction). lipgloss `Width()` wraps
rather than truncates, so a header wider than its budget becomes a multi-line
string occupying a slot the layout counts as one line, desynchronising row
accounting below it. Reproducible today with a long section name and no
aggregate at all: a 36-character name wraps to three lines at width 20.

Channel rows do not have this problem — they truncate explicitly via
`truncate.StringWithTail`. Headers never got the same treatment.

This feature does not cause it but does consume headroom: a mention badge adds
up to 6 columns (separator, two padding cells, and up to three digits), so a
default `Channels` header that previously fit a narrow sidebar can now exceed
it. The fix is to give the header a width budget and truncate its display name,
which changes expanded headers too and therefore belongs in its own change.
