# Phase 0 — Test Safety Net

Design for the first phase of the architecture refactor tracked in
[`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-06-architecture-refactor.md`](../plans/2026-09-06-architecture-refactor.md).

## Problem

The codebase is about to undergo four phases of structural refactoring: two on
`cmd/slk/main.go`, one collapsing the `messages`/`thread` copy-fork, and one
finishing the `App` decomposition. The existing test suite protects some of
that work and none of the rest.

What it protects: the dominant test style in `internal/ui` is "send a
`tea.Msg` to `App.Update`, assert on resulting state." That style is immune to
code motion. The prior SOLID refactor proved it — Phase 4 moved 75 message
arms across 14 files (+2,319/−1,519) and Phase 6 split `View` into 9 files
(+722/−403), both with **zero** test changes.

What it does not protect:

1. **Rendering.** There are no golden or snapshot tests anywhere in the repo.
   The entire rendering contract is 294 `.View(` calls checked with 584
   `strings.Contains` assertions. Nothing pins layout, column widths, border
   characters, wrapping, ANSI attributes, or panel composition. Phase 6 of the
   prior refactor restructured `View()` with zero test churn — which means it
   could equally have broken rendering with zero test failures.

   `internal/ui/view_composite_test.go` is worse than absent. Its helper
   `buildViewPanels` duplicates `App.View`'s panel assembly rather than calling
   it, so it can pass while the real path is broken.

2. **`cmd/slk`.** 36.9% statement coverage; 44 of `main.go`'s 85 functions are
   at 0%. `run`, `connectWorkspace`, and 14 of the 24 `rtmEventHandler` methods
   have no tests at all. Phases 1 and 2 operate entirely inside this file.

3. **Keyboard dispatch.** 7 of the 16 mode handlers are at 0% coverage;
   `mode_normal.go` is at 41% and `mode_insert.go` at 53%. Keybindings are the
   product surface of a TUI.

Two structural weaknesses compound this:

- **15 ad-hoc test-app builders** (`newTestAppWithMessages`, `searchTestApp`,
  `newWideTestApp`, `sixelTestApp`, `linkTestApp`, `twoWindowApp`,
  `sameChannelApp`, `newFinderApp`, `newPanelAtApp`, `newTestAppWithThreadsView`,
  `newApp_WithOpenConvCapture`, `openChannelFinder`, `setupAppForTitleTest`,
  `makeBenchApp`, `makeWideScrollApp`). 90.7% of `internal/ui` tests (399 of
  440) read unexported `App` fields — 1,729 occurrences, led by `.messagepane`
  (209), `.activeChannelID` (123) and `.mode` (114). Phase 4 relocates exactly
  those fields, and the construction change would have to be reconciled in
  fifteen places.

- **A live flake.** `TestUserResolver_RequestDoesNotBlockTheCaller`
  (`cmd/slk/user_resolver_test.go:78`) fails roughly one run in five under
  parallel package load — a hard 2-second wall-clock deadline. Repo-wide there
  are 36 `time.Sleep` calls and 17 wall-clock deadline polls. Two "fix flaky
  test" commits are already in recent history; `8eaeba9`'s message reads *"fix
  flaky backoff-expiry test that reddened unrelated PRs."* Red noise during a
  refactor destroys the signal the refactor depends on.

## Goal

Make Phases 1–4 safe to execute. Phase 0 adds no user-visible value; its entire
return is that the subsequent phases can be verified.

## Non-goals

- No production refactoring. The single production change in this phase is a
  clock injection required for deterministic goldens.
- No fixing of behavior discovered while writing characterization tests. Record
  it, annotate it, raise it separately.
- No reworking of the command-drivers (`press`, `drainBatch`, `typeCommand`) or
  the view-mirror helpers. `buildViewPanels` is superseded by the goldens and
  should be deleted in Phase 4, not repaired now.
- No coverage gate in CI. Coverage is a diagnostic here, not a contract.

---

## 1. Determinism contract

A golden render is meaningful only if every global the render path reads is
pinned. `internal/ui` has several, and at least one is already mutated by both
production code and tests.

| Global | Pinned to | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `styles.Apply("dark", config.Theme{})` | dark, no overrides | Package-global. Mutated in production by `mode_theme_switcher.go` and in tests by `reducer_search_test.go:437`. |
| `emoji.SetImageMode(false, 2)` | off | Package-global (`internal/emoji/imagemode.go:24`). When on, emoji render as kitty APC escapes. |
| `messages.SetNowFunc(fixedClock)` | 2026-03-15 12:00 UTC | New. See below. |
| `sidebar.SetNowFunc(fixedClock)` | same instant | Already exists at `internal/ui/sidebar/model.go:500`. |
| `App.spinnerFrame` | `0` | Animation frame appears in the loading overlay and status row. |
| `App.avatarFn` | `nil` | Avatars emit kitty graphics or half-block escapes. |
| `App.imgProtocol` | `imgpkg.ProtoNone` | Inline images emit protocol escapes. |
| `App.nowTimestampFormatter` | fixed string | Used by the optimistic-send path. |

All pins are installed by the harness and reverted with `t.Cleanup`.

Anything that cannot be pinned is a latent nondeterminism bug; the goldens will
surface it as flakiness immediately, which is a useful result rather than a
setback.

### The clock injection

`messages.FormatDateSeparator` (`internal/ui/messages/model.go:3490`) calls
`time.Now()` directly to choose between "Today", "Yesterday", a weekday name,
and an absolute date. A golden containing a "Today" divider would rot at
midnight.

Two options were considered. Dating all fixture messages far in the past would
avoid the problem with no production change, but would leave the
Today/Yesterday/weekday branches ungoldened — and that is precisely the code
that carried the timezone bug fixed in `aef453e`.

**Decision:** add a package-level clock to `internal/ui/messages`, mirroring the
shape the sidebar already uses:

```go
// nowFunc is the clock FormatDateSeparator reads. Tests override it via
// SetNowFunc so day-divider labels are deterministic.
var nowFunc = time.Now

// SetNowFunc injects a clock. Pass nil to revert to time.Now.
func SetNowFunc(fn func() time.Time)
```

This is the only production change in Phase 0.

A broader clock injection threaded through `App` — covering sidebar staleness,
DND expiry, and typing expiry from one seam — is the cleaner long-term design
but is a real refactor and belongs in a later phase.

---

## 2. Golden infrastructure

```
internal/ui/testdata/golden/<scenario>.ansi   raw bytes of a.View().Content
internal/ui/golden_test.go                    harness + scenario table
```

**Storage format:** raw ANSI, exact bytes, trailing newline normalized.

Stripped-text goldens were considered and rejected. Roughly half of what a
`messages`/`thread` merge can break is styling — selection highlight, unread
bold, muted dimming, reaction pills — and none of it survives ANSI stripping.
The `drag_selection` scenario below differs from `base` *only* in escape
sequences.

**Blessing:** `go test ./internal/ui -run TestGolden -update`, gated on a single
`var update = flag.Bool("update", false, ...)`.

**Failure output** is the part that determines whether this suite survives
contact with real use. On mismatch:

- If the ANSI-stripped text differs, print a unified line diff of the stripped
  text. This is the readable, common case.
- If the stripped text is identical, print `content identical, styling differs`
  plus the byte offset of the first difference and a hex window around it.
  Without this branch, a lost selection highlight produces an unreadable wall of
  escape sequences and the reviewer blesses it blind.

**Blank-screen guard:** a separate test asserts each golden is non-empty and its
line count equals the scenario's configured height. Blessing an empty golden is
the standard way a snapshot suite quietly dies.

---

## 3. Scenarios

Eight full-screen goldens. Full-screen rather than per-region because
composition — panel order, width distribution, border placement, overlay
compositing — is what `View()` actually does, and it is what Phases 3 and 4
threaten.

| # | Name | Config | What it pins |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `base` | 120×30, sidebar + messages | Day separator, reactions, attachment, bot message, reply count, unread divider |
| 2 | `thread_open` | 120×30, + thread pane | Three-pane composition, thread chrome |
| 3 | `wide` | 200×50, all panes | Width distribution at scale |
| 4 | `narrow` | 80×24 | `ThreadAutoHidden` collapse and the focus fallback to `PanelMessages` (`app.go:2726`) |
| 5 | `no_sidebar` | 120×30, sidebar hidden | Two-pane composition |
| 6 | `drag_selection` | 120×30, active selection | Selection styling — the main visual output of the drag/selection code Phase 3 touches |
| 7 | `overlay_finder` | 120×30, channel finder open | `applyOverlays` compositing (`view_overlays.go:39`) |
| 8 | `window_split` | 160×40, two wintree leaves | `renderWindowNode` recursion; focused vs unfocused pane borders |

Fixture message content is shared across scenarios and defined once, so a
content tweak re-blesses all eight consistently rather than drifting apart.

---

## 4. Test harness

A single functional-options builder in a new `internal/ui/testapp_test.go`:

```go
func newTestApp(t *testing.T, opts ...testOpt) *App
```

Options are derived from what the 15 existing builders actually vary. Nothing
speculative is added.

| Option | Existing builders that need it |
|---|---|
| `withSize(w, h)` | `newWideTestApp`, `newPanelAtApp`, `makeWideScrollApp`, `sixelTestApp` |
| `withMessages(...)` | `newTestAppWithMessages`, `searchTestApp`, `makeBenchApp` |
| `withChannels(...)` | `newFinderApp`, `newPanelAtApp` |
| `withThreadsView(summaries)` | `newTestAppWithThreadsView` |
| `withWindowSplit(n)` | `twoWindowApp`, `sameChannelApp` |
| `withChannelService(funcs)` | `newFinderApp`, `newApp_WithOpenConvCapture`, `linkTestApp` |
| `withRender()` | ~8 builders (the `_ = a.View()` line that populates `a.layout`) |
| `withMode(m)` | `openChannelFinder` |
| `withActiveChannel(id)` | `setupAppForTitleTest` |

Each of the 15 legacy builders is then reimplemented as a wrapper:

```go
func newTestAppWithMessages(t *testing.T) *App {
	t.Helper()
	return newTestApp(t, withSize(120, 30), withMessages(twoSampleMessages...), withRender())
}
```

**No test body changes.** Helper names and signatures are preserved, so none of
the ~440 test functions is touched. The payoff is Phase 4: when `a.userNames`
becomes `a.directory.userNames`, App construction changes in one place.

Migrating every call site to `newTestApp` directly was considered and rejected —
it would touch hundreds of test functions for no behavioral gain and carries a
real risk of silently altering a test's setup during mechanical edits.

`newGoldenApp` is `newTestApp` plus the section 1 determinism pins, so golden
and non-golden tests share construction and a golden failure cannot be caused by
harness drift.

---

## 5. Flake elimination

**Rule:** a test may wait on a signal indefinitely — `go test`'s own timeout is
the backstop — but may not assert that work completed within a wall-clock
budget.

The one apparent exception, `TestUserResolver_RequestDoesNotBlockTheCaller`, is
not really an exception. Its point is that `Request` does not block, which is a
happens-before relation: assert that `Request` returns while the transport is
still blocked, not that it returns inside two seconds.

Targets, in descending order of observed noise:

| File | Sleeps | Deadlines | Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cmd/slk/user_resolver_test.go` | 8 | 6 | The confirmed flake. Signal from the fake batcher's flush instead of `Sleep(batchWindow + 300ms)`; convert the 2s deadline to a happens-before assertion |
| `cmd/slk/thread_subscriptions_test.go` | 3 | 10 | Gate on channel receive |
| `internal/slack/membership/manager_test.go` | 7 | 5 | Inject a clock for backoff expiry (already has one flaky-fix commit, `8eaeba9`) |
| `internal/avatar/avatar_test.go` | 6 | 3 | Signal from `SetOnReady` instead of sleeping |
| `internal/wake/detector_test.go` | 3 | 2 | `fakeClock` already exists; finish the job |
| `internal/emoji/place_test.go` | 3 | 5 | Signal on the ready callback |

Most `time.Now().Add(...)` occurrences in `internal/ui` are fixture data (DND
end timestamps), not deadlines, and are left alone.

---

## 6. Mode characterization

**These are characterization tests, not specification tests.** They record what
the code does today so that refactoring cannot change it silently. Where a table
entry documents behavior that looks wrong, it is recorded as-is with a `// BUG?:`
annotation and raised separately. Fixing behavior inside a safety-net change
defeats the purpose of the safety net.

One file per mode, `internal/ui/mode_<name>_test.go`, each a table:

```go
tests := []struct {
	name     string
	setup    func(*App)   // preconditions beyond the harness default
	key      tea.KeyMsg
	wantMode Mode
	assert   func(*testing.T, *App, tea.Cmd)
}{...}
```

Dispatch goes through `dispatchModeKey(a, key)` (`mode_handlers.go:92`) rather
than `App.Update`, so a failure localizes to the handler rather than to the
reducer chain. Each case runs against a fresh `newTestApp`.

There are **16** modes (`mode.go`), all 16 registered in `modeHandlers`:

| Mode | Statements | Current coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `mode_normal` | 131 | 41% |
| `mode_insert` | 128 | 53% |
| `mode_reaction_picker` | 31 | 0% |
| `mode_theme_switcher` | 23 | 0% (mutates global `styles`; needs cleanup) |
| `mode_presence_menu` | 23 | 0% |
| `mode_new_message` | 21 | 0% |
| `mode_presence_snooze` | 20 | 0% |
| `mode_workspace_finder` | 19 | 0% |
| `mode_reactions_view` | 9 | 0% |
| `command`, `search`, `channel_finder`, `confirm`, `help`, `link_picker`, `workspace_search` | — | partial |

Two findings are anticipated and are results rather than failures:

- Some keys will prove dead, handled by a reducer before `dispatchModeKey` is
  reached. The table makes that visible.
- `handleNormalMode` is the fallback for unregistered modes
  (`mode_handlers.go:96`), so some modal handlers may leak normal-mode keys.
  Recording that is the point. All 16 modes are currently registered, so this
  fallback should be unreachable in practice — a test asserting that is worth
  including.

---

## 7. `messages`/`thread` lockstep test

`internal/ui/thread/model.go:37` documents a maintained-by-hand invariant:

> *"This shape mirrors internal/ui/messages.viewEntry **exactly**; keeping them
> in lockstep means scroll and selection logic can be kept in sync."*

377 verbatim lines and 45 identically-named methods currently rest on a comment.
Phase 3 removes the duplication, but Phases 1 and 2 land first, and any change
to either file in the interim can silently break the parity that Phase 3's
extraction will assume.

Add `internal/ui/thread/lockstep_test.go`: feed the same message list to
`messages.Model` and `thread.Model` and assert their rendered output matches for
the shared subset of behaviors — plain message rows, day separators, reaction
pills, wrapping at the same width, and selection range rendering.

Where output legitimately differs (the parent row, the unread boundary, thread
chrome), the test documents the difference explicitly rather than skipping it.
That list *is* the specification for Phase 3's divergence hooks, so writing it
now is design work for Phase 3, not just testing.

This test is deleted by Phase 3, when the two models become one. That is the
intended lifecycle, not waste.

---

## Success criteria

Phase 0 is complete when all of the following hold:

1. `go test ./... -race -count=5` is green — five consecutive full runs, no flake.
2. Eight golden files exist, and deliberately perturbing panel order, a border
   character, or the selection style makes the corresponding golden fail.
3. All 15 legacy builders are wrappers over `newTestApp`, with no changes inside
   any test body.
4. Every one of the 16 mode handlers is above 85% statement coverage, except
   `mode_normal` and `mode_insert`, which must be above 80% (they are 3–6×
   larger than the rest and contain rarely-reachable arms).
5. `internal/ui` package coverage is above its 67.8% baseline.
6. Exactly one production change in the phase: `messages.SetNowFunc`.
7. A `messages`/`thread` lockstep test exists, passes, and enumerates every
   legitimate divergence between the two models.

`cmd/slk` coverage is explicitly *not* a Phase 0 criterion; raising it is
Phase 1 and 2's job, and it depends on extractions that Phase 0 does not make.

## Delivery

Four independent PRs off a `refactor/phase0-safety-net` worktree:

| PR | Contents |
|---|---|
| **0b** | `newTestApp` + 15 wrappers |
| **0a** | Golden infrastructure + 8 scenarios + `messages.SetNowFunc` |
| **0c** | Flake fixes (6 files) |
| **0d** | Mode characterization (16 files) |
| **0e** | `messages`/`thread` lockstep test |

0b lands first: it is pure mechanical refactoring with no new assertions, and 0a
builds `newGoldenApp` on top of it. 0c, 0d and 0e are independent of both and of
each other.
