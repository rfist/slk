// Package bootstrap owns the sequence of API calls slk makes when it
// connects to a workspace.
//
// It exists as a package, rather than as more of cmd/slk/main.go's
// connectWorkspace, for one reason: this sequence is what gets slk's
// Enterprise Grid users signed out for "data scraping", and inside
// connectWorkspace no test could reach it. connectWorkspace builds a
// live *slack.Client and calls Connect, so there is no seam without a
// live Slack connection. Everything here takes an interface.
//
// The call budget is the point. Across 8 captures of the official web
// client, a boot issues ~70 API requests and NEVER enumerates: zero
// users.list, zero conversations.list, zero per-channel
// conversations.history. slk previously issued roughly 400 and did all
// three. TestRun_NeverEnumerates is the regression guard.
//
// # Import direction
//
// This package must NOT import internal/slack. Phase 2b makes
// internal/slack import internal/slack/boot, and cmd/slk wires slack
// and bootstrap together; keeping the dependency pointing one way is
// what lets boot and edge stay stdlib-only parsers. The visible cost is
// that Result carries the RAW all_notifications_prefs string rather
// than a parsed mute list — the caller parses it with
// slack.ParseMutedFromAllNotificationsPrefs — and that Counts restates
// slack.UnreadInfo and slack.ThreadsAggregate rather than reusing them.
//
// internal/cache IS imported, and that is not a hole in the rule: the
// dependency runs inward, since cache imports neither bootstrap nor
// slack. What it buys is cache.MembershipSnapshot and the
// EdgeXFromEdge update structs travelling through the Store interface
// with their own semantics intact — see Store.
