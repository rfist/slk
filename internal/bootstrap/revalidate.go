// revalidate refreshes the cache against edgeapi instead of
// enumerating it.
//
// This is the function that replaces slk's ~50-page users.list sweep.
// The official client issues zero users.list and zero
// conversations.list calls across all 8 captures; it sends
// {id: version} for what it holds and gets back only what moved. A
// fully current cache costs one ~290-byte response per batch.
//
// The id sets are deliberately SCOPED rather than "everything cached":
//
//   - channels: userBoot's channels + ims, i.e. what the sidebar will
//     actually render.
//   - users: the authors conversations.view returned, plus open-DM
//     counterparties.
//
// Everything else is left stale and revalidated when first needed. A
// fixed batch size over an unbounded id set emits a long run of
// identically-sized requests — 125 consecutive exactly-80s on a
// 10k-user workspace — which is a cleaner distributional signature
// than the client's own ragged 1-80 spread. Scoping is the fix; jitter
// would be inventing a shape no capture shows.
//
// Errors are non-fatal. A stale cache renders; a workspace that failed
// to boot does not.

	//
	// The rule is the same in both places — a wiring bug must not
	// panic — but the consequence differs. A missing Viewer means no
	// channel opens; a missing Revalidator means the cache stays as
	// stale as it already was, which is exactly the outcome of a
	// revalidation request that fails, and that outcome is documented

// revalidateChannels conditionally refreshes the conversations the
// sidebar will render: userBoot's channels plus its ims, and nothing
// else in the cache.
//
// The id set is partitioned by each conversation's context_team_id,
// and each team gets its own channels/info call. On Enterprise Grid a
// user's conversations are owned by many teams within the org and the
// edge cache keys records under the owning team: a single call scoped
// to the auth.test team resolved zero of one Grid user's 217
// conversations (gammons/slk#5). On a non-Grid workspace every
// context team is expected to be the workspace team, so the partition
// is a single group and the request shape is identical to before. An
// empty context team groups under the workspace team, preserving the
// old behaviour for anything the field is missing on.
//
// The ims are included on purpose even though channels/info cannot
// resolve them. Measured across the captures: of 193 ids the official
// client sent to this endpoint, 22 were IM ids, and **all 22 came back
// in failed_ids** — none appeared in results, none in member_channels.
// So the official client sends them and they always fail, and matching
// that is the point of this package.
//
// Two consequences worth knowing before anyone "optimises" ims out of
// this set, which would be a divergence from the client:
//
//   - No IM is ever written by UpdateChannelFromEdge, because IMs never
//     come back as results. A DM's cached name and type cannot be
//     corrupted from here.
//   - Every IM lands in FailedIDs, and ApplyMembership preserves failed
//     ids rather than clearing them. That is the only reason DMs keep
//     is_member across a boot. Removing the failed-id exclusion would
//     mark every DM a non-membership on the next revalidation.
