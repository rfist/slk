// internal/ui/location.go
//
// Location is the shared address type for navigable positions in a
// workspace: the currency of the navigation history, permalink jumps,
// and vim-style marks. It is deliberately the same shape as
// slackurl.Permalink (internal/slackurl/slackurl.go) with the
// workspace subdomain replaced by the team ID, because the team ID is
// what workspaceContext and every cache table key on.

// within that channel and a thread the message belongs to. A location
// that names only a channel remains valid and means "the channel, at
// its default position".
