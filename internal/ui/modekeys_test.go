// TestEveryModeHasAHandler pins the registration invariant.
// dispatchModeKey falls back to handleNormalMode for unregistered modes
// (mode_handlers.go:96); that fallback should be unreachable because all
// 16 modes are registered, and a mode that reached it would silently
// serve normal-mode behaviour to a modal.
//
// What this test detects:
//
//   - a modeHandlers entry deleted — len(modeHandlers) drops below
//     len(all), and the loop names the orphaned mode;
//   - a 17th Mode added AND registered — len(modeHandlers) exceeds
//     len(all), forcing the pinned list below to be updated;
//   - a 17th Mode added, NOT registered, but given a String() arm — the
//     Mode(len(all)) probe below stops answering "UNKNOWN".
//
// What it cannot detect: a 17th Mode with neither a handler nor a
// String() arm. `all` is a hand-maintained literal, and Mode is a bare
// int iota with no count sentinel (mode.go:4-23), so nothing available
// to test code ties the list to the constant block. Closing that
// residual gap would take a production change (a ModeCount sentinel, or
// a generated stringer), which this PR's budget does not allow. The
// String() probe covers the overwhelmingly likely shape of the mistake,
// since a new mode needs a String() arm for the statusbar.

// Quit/ctrl+c intercept (app.go:708), the bootstrap-loading gate
// (app.go:715) and the scroll-coalesce flush (app.go:724). ctrl+c is

// directly. The plan's brief prescribed the direct assignment, on the
// theory that SetMode's side effects would contaminate the
// precondition. On a freshly built App they do not: of SetMode's three
// guarded branches (app.go:1640) the chord disarm needs pendingWinCmd
// set, the cmdline clear needs the App to already be in ModeCommand,
// and the ModeInsert branch calls clearSelections, which is a no-op
// with no selection active. What SetMode does unconditionally is
// a.statusbar.SetMode(mode) -- and skipping that is the contaminating
// choice, not the safe one: it would leave the statusbar reading
// "NORMAL" while a.mode says otherwise, a state production never
// reaches, since every production mode change goes through SetMode.
//
// withMode is appended last so the mode argument is authoritative: a
// withMode in a case's opts cannot silently redirect the table to
// another handler. A case that genuinely needs a different mode at
// dispatch time should set it in setup.
