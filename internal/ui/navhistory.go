// internal/ui/navhistory.go
//
// Per-workspace browser-style back/forward history of locations.
//
// Phase 2 of the SOLID refactor of internal/ui/app.go: extracts the
// navHistory map + the pushNavHistory / navigateBack / navigateForward
// / walkNav / dropStaleStackEntries quartet out of App into a
// self-contained information holder.
//
// App keeps thin wrappers (navigateBack / navigateForward) that turn
// this store's pure data-structure result into a tea.Cmd carrying a
// ChannelSelectedMsg{FromHistory:true}. Everything else — the stale-
// entry skip-and-drop FSM, the cap-at-50 eviction, the forward-path
// truncation on new visits — lives here.
//
// Tests that previously did `app.navHistory["T1"]` now use
// `app.navHistory.Stack("T1")`. The returned *navStack pointer is the
// same one the store holds, so mutating cursor/entries through it
// continues to work for white-box tests.

//   - Dedupes consecutive: a no-op if the entry at the cursor names the
//     same channel as loc — returning to a channel at a different
//     position is still not a new entry.

//     are dropped (browser-style "new visit kills forward history").
