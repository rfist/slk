//
// The ' chord (and its backtick alias) arms a pending-key state and
// the next key names the mark to jump to, modelled on the m chord
// (set_mark.go). Unmapped keys cancel silently. The jump hands the
// mark's Location to the shared applyLocation applier, so it inherits
// the permalink/history pipeline: channel open, surrounding-history
// load on a stale target, thread open with the reply selected.

//     leaves the user in place and toasts.
//
// A mark whose MESSAGE is gone is not a refusal: the channel opens and
// the existing completePendingLinkNav / MessagesAroundLoadedMsg
// pipeline toasts "Message not found", leaving the mark intact.
