// observed channels/info responses, every one of which sent
// check_membership:true — one of them having asked about 11 ids, another
// about 20. Reading that absence as "none of these are members" marks
// the user a non-member of all 20 on an ordinary channel switch,
// silently. encoding/json cannot tell the two apart either: an absent
// key and a literal [] both decode to a nil slice.
//
// A constructor call rather than a struct literal with a bool field
// means a caller cannot forget the distinction — there is no field to
// leave unset — and cannot forget failed_ids, which is a positional
// argument of the only constructor that clears anything. The zero value
// is the unreported one, so the accident is always toward preserving.

// failedIDs is the response's failed_ids. It is required rather than
// optional because a caller who omits it clears is_member for ids the
// server explicitly could not answer about — in 4 of the 5 observed
// responses carrying member_channels, members plus failures accounted
// for every id sent (52+11=63, 29+2=31, 20+0=20, 1+0=1), so the
// omission is not a rare edge.
//

// is a non-member and is cleared.

func MembershipUnreported() MembershipSnapshot { return MembershipSnapshot{} }

// ApplyMembership records the membership snapshot from a channels/info
// response.
//
// queriedIDs is every id the request sent. What happens to each of them
// depends on what the response actually said:
//
//   - snap unreported: nothing is written at all. See MembershipSnapshot.
//   - id in member_channels: is_member set.
//   - id in failed_ids: preserved. The server could not resolve the id,
//     which is not an answer about membership; clearing it would treat a
//     lookup error as a departure, and setting it would invent one.
//   - id queried, reported on, and in neither list: cleared. This is the
//     only genuine non-membership.
//
// An id that was never queried is untouched in every case —
// member_channels is a snapshot over what was asked, not a
// workspace-wide list, so treating unqueried ids as non-members would
// drop the user out of every channel outside the current batch.
//
// An id in both lists is treated as a member: an affirmative naming
// outranks a failure to resolve.
//
// # Building the snapshot from edge.ChannelsInfoResult
//
// ChannelsInfoResult carries MemberChannels and FailedIDs but does not
// record presence, and cannot as written: encoding/json gives a nil
// slice for both an absent member_channels and a literal []. A caller
// therefore has only one signal available today, and must use it:
//
//	snap := cache.MembershipUnreported()
//	if len(res.MemberChannels) > 0 {
//		snap = cache.MembershipReported(res.MemberChannels, res.FailedIDs)
//	}
//
// Passing MembershipReported unconditionally is the bug this type
// exists to prevent. The heuristic's one blind spot is a response that
// reported an explicitly empty member_channels: that reads as
// unreported, so a channel the user left stays marked joined until some
// later response names members. No observed response is in that state —
// all 5 that carried member_channels named at least one id — and the
// error direction is a stale join flag rather than dropping the user
// out of every channel in the batch.
//
// There is a second hazard the caller cannot work around, and it is why
// edge should expose presence itself. ChannelsInfo accumulates over
// 60-id batches, so one ChannelsInfoResult can span responses that
// disagree: if the first batch reports membership and the second does
// not, the accumulated result looks reported while holding no answer at
// all for the second batch's ids — and applying it against the full
// queried set clears every one of them. With member_channels absent
// from 13 of 18 responses, mixed batches are the expected case, not a
// corner. Until edge records which ids were covered by a reporting
// batch, a caller must keep each ApplyMembership call to a single
// batch's worth of ids.
