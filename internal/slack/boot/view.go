	//  1. Nothing consumes them yet. This package is parser-only and
	//     unwired; Phase 2b is what feeds them to the renderer.
	//  2. slk models messages as slack-go's slack.Message
	//     (internal/slack/client.go). json.Unmarshal from a
	//     RawMessage into a slack.Message is lossless and one line, so
	//     deferring costs the wiring phase nothing — whereas defining
	//     a *second* message type here would create two shapes that
	//     have to be kept in agreement forever.
	//  3. The message shape VARIES. Across the 56 messages in the two
	//     captures there are 17 distinct keys, and only 8 are on all
	//     56 (user, type, ts, client_msg_id, text, team, blocks,
	//     reactions). The other 9 — thread_ts, reply_count,
	//     reply_users, reply_users_count, latest_reply, subscribed,
	//     is_locked, edited, attachments — appear on 4 to 16 of them.
	//     Declaring a struct from that is inventing a contract, which
	//     is the failure this phase exists to correct.
	//
	//     An earlier version of this comment said "only 8 message keys
	//     were captured", which was true of the committed extract
	//     (messages[0] of one sample) and false of the captures. The
	//     conclusion is unchanged and if anything better supported: 17
	//     keys of which 9 are optional is a stronger argument for raw
	//     bytes than 8 fixed ones. Only the evidence was wrong — a
	//     per-field claim about an array element needs a denominator.
	//
	// Honest cost, stated so it is a choice and not an accident:
	// raw bytes mean a message whose shape slk cannot handle fails
	// later, at render, instead of here at decode. That is a

//
// It does NOT replace emoji.list: everything it returns beside the
// history is scoped to that conversation. See the Emojis field.
//
// # The channel param: verified off Grid, unverified on it
//
// Read this before relying on channelID.
//
// Both HAR captures of this endpoint carried NO `channel` param at
// all, and the response was the conversation the user had last
// viewed. slk needs a specific conversation, so this function sends
// `channel` when channelID is non-empty and omits it entirely when
// channelID is empty, reproducing the captured request byte for byte
// in the latter case.
//
// VERIFIED 2026-08-01, and what that does and does not settle:
//
//   - Known: two live NON-GRID workspaces both honoured the param.
//     Each boot opened a specific channel and got that channel back —
//     ViewResult.Channel.ID equalled the requested id, and neither run
//     logged the caller's "ignored the channel param" fallback line.
//     Until then this was an unmeasured assumption, however obvious
//     the parameter name.
//   - NOT known: Enterprise Grid. conversations.view has never been
//     captured there under any parameters, and Grid is the environment
//     this package exists for. Two observations off Grid say nothing
//     about the method existing on it, let alone about this param.
//
// So the caller's probe-and-compare stays mandatory, unchanged. Two
// samples on the easy environment are not a contract, and the failure
// they would miss is the silent one below.
//
// Callers MUST be able to detect the assumption failing, and there
// are two distinct failure modes:
//
//   - Loud: Slack rejects the param and answers ok:false. This returns
//     an error and no data.
//   - SILENT, and the dangerous one: Slack IGNORES the unknown param
//     and answers with the last-viewed conversation, ok:true, a
//     perfectly well-formed body full of the wrong channel's messages.
//     No error can be raised for this from inside the parser.
//
// The second is why ViewResult.Channel.ID is exposed. A caller
// verifies the probe by comparing it to the channelID it asked for; if
// they differ, the param is not honoured on this workspace and the
// result must be discarded. The verified fallback is conversations.history
// with limit=28 and cached_latest_updates (Task 9). Phase 2b probes
// once, checks Channel.ID, and falls back for the session on either
// failure mode.
//
// # Envelope
//
// ctx is passed through untouched, and this function sets no _x_
// param. In particular it does NOT call slackhttp.WithReason:
// conversations.view is in slackhttp's xReasonExcludedMethods AND its
// xModeExcludedMethods, because the official client sends neither flag
// on it. _x_sonic and _x_app_name are added by
// slackhttp.BrowserTransport. Adding any of them here would put a
// duplicate on the wire — and a caller-supplied form param is the ONE
// route by which a suppressed _x_reason could come back, since
// applyEnvelopeBody only ever appends and never removes what the
// caller sent.
//
// # Errors
//
// Any error returns a nil ViewResult. That is load-bearing, not
// tidiness: encoding/json populates a struct as it goes and keeps
// decoding past the first type error, and `ok` is only inspected after
// the whole body has been decoded — so at both failure points there is
// a fully populated ViewResult sitting in a local. Handing it back
// would give the caller a plausible-looking channel built from a
