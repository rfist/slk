// Batch sizes for the conditional-revalidation endpoints.
//
// These are not documented limits. They are caps chosen at or just
// under the largest batch the official web client has been observed
// sending, measured across 8 HAR captures of a live NON-Grid
// workspace (Rands, T04T4TH8W). No Grid capture of edgeapi exists;
// behaviour there is inferred from a user's log, not observed:
//
//	channels/info   18 requests, 1–63 ids per request
//	users/info      30 requests, 1–80 ids per request
//
// Read that distribution honestly: neither endpoint shows any
// client-side cap. Batch size there just tracks how many ids happened
// to need checking, so 63 and 80 are demand, not contract — and that
// cuts against us, not for us. A *fixed* batch size is itself a known
// residual divergence: the official client emits ragged,
// demand-driven sizes, while we emit a run of requests each carrying
// exactly batchSize ids followed by one short tail. A cold
// revalidation of a 10k-user workspace is 125 consecutive
// exactly-80-id requests, which is a cleaner machine-detectable
// signature than the ragged shape it is supposed to be imitating.
//
// Deliberately not "fixed" by jittering or randomising the size.
// Nothing in the captures says what a jittered distribution should
// look like, so inventing one is the Phase 1 failure mode again: a
// plausible-but-wrong shape is worse than an honestly-declared
// divergence, the same way a made-up sec-ch-ua is worse than none.
//
// The real fix is Phase 2b — scope revalidation to the ids that
// actually need checking instead of sweeping the whole cache, which
// makes our sizes demand-driven for the same reason the official
// client's are. Until then these constants are a necessary upper
// bound on request size, and the resulting uniformity is a divergence
// that is known and accepted rather than solved.

// It is generic over the whole per-batch response rather than over the
// result element type, which is the change the captures forced: the
// two endpoints no longer share a response shape. channels/info
// carries member_channels and failed_ids alongside results;
// users/info carries neither and carries can_interact instead. A
// helper parameterised on the element type could only have grown a
// second return value that users/info always left empty, or the
// `endpoint == "channels/info"` string comparison that was rejected
// outright.
//
// Splitting this into two functions was the alternative and was
// rejected: what the endpoints still share is exactly the part that is
// easy to get subtly wrong and expensive to get wrong twice — the
// trailing-partial-batch guard, never sending an empty batch, a fresh
// batch map per flush, and abort-on-first-error. What differs is
// decoding and accumulation, which is now entirely in the caller's
// merge closure where it is plain to read. So the generic earns its
// place, just on a different axis than before.
//
// merge is called once per successful batch, in request order, with
// the decoded response and the ids that batch sent, and never after an
// error.
//
// That second argument is what lets a caller attribute a per-batch
// answer to the right ids. channels/info needs it: member_channels is
// scoped to the batch that asked, and is absent from 13 of 18 observed
// responses, so a caller accumulating across batches must be able to
// record which ids a reporting batch actually covered. Passing it to
// every merge keeps that out of a per-endpoint branch — the
// `endpoint == "channels/info"` comparison this design already
// rejected once — and users/info simply ignores it.
//
// The slice is freshly allocated per batch and handed over: fetchInfo
// keeps no reference and never mutates it, so merge may retain it. Its
// order is whatever ranging the id map produced and means nothing;
// only the set does.
//
// A failed batch fails the whole call and the
// caller discards what already merged: returning partial results with
// a nil error would be indistinguishable from "only these entries
// changed", so a caller would mark the unfetched ids current and never
// revalidate them again.
//
// The "never after an error" half is unobservable through ChannelsInfo
// and UsersInfo — both return the zero value on any error, so calling
// merge with a half-decoded response would look identical from
// outside. It is not harmless inside here: call's final
// json.Unmarshal can populate part of resp before returning an error,
// so a merge on a failed batch would splice fragments of a broken
// response into the accumulator. That is why it is pinned directly,
// against fetchInfo rather than through the exported methods — see
// TestFetchInfo_DoesNotMergeAnErroredBatch.
