# Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/slk/config.toml`.

## Full example

```toml
[general]
default_workspace = "work"      # the slug, not the team ID
use_slack_sections = true       # use real Slack sidebar sections (default).
                                # set false to use [sections.*] globs instead.

[appearance]
theme = "dracula"
timestamp_format = "3:04 PM"
image_protocol = "auto"   # auto | kitty | sixel | halfblock | off
max_image_rows = 20       # cap inline image height in terminal rows
colored_usernames = false # color each user's name by ID hash (Slack-style)

[animations]
enabled = true
smooth_scrolling = true
typing_indicators = true

[notifications]
enabled = true
on_mention = true
on_dm = true
on_keyword = ["deploy", "incident"]
quiet_hours = "22:00-08:00"   # planned

# notify_command (optional): run INSTEAD of the built-in OS notification for any
# message that would notify (DM / mention / keyword). Executed via `sh -c` with
# $SLK_TITLE and $SLK_BODY set, so you can route notifications through your own
# tooling (terminal-notifier, a multiplexer's notifier, mako, ...). Values are
# passed via the environment, so message text can't inject shell syntax.
# notify_command = 'terminal-notifier -title "$SLK_TITLE" -message "$SLK_BODY"'

# status_command (optional): run on every unread-state change (a message arrives
# or a channel is read) so an external surface can mirror slk's unread state.
# Because it fires on reads too, it can clear a status as well as set one.
# Runs are serialized and coalesced: states never run concurrently or out of
# order, and under a burst intermediate states may be skipped — the newest
# state always runs last, so the surface converges on the current state.
# Executed via `sh -c` with:
#   $SLK_UNREAD        unread channels in the active workspace (mute-filtered)
#   $SLK_OTHER_UNREAD  unread count across other workspaces
#   $SLK_WORKSPACE     active workspace name
#   $SLK_TITLE         the window-title string, e.g. "slk SW (3) +1"
# status_command = 'my-statusbar --slack-unread "$SLK_UNREAD"'

# Both hooks require a POSIX `sh` on $PATH and are unavailable on Windows
# (the built-in OS notification still works there). Hook failures are silent
# in the UI; run slk with SLK_DEBUG=1 and check slk-debug.log ([notify] lines)
# to diagnose a misbehaving command.

# Muted channels and DMs never notify — including on mentions and keywords —
# matching Slack. (This is a behavior change: previously a mention or keyword
# in a muted channel would still notify.)

persist_all = false

# Pressing ' opens the marks overlay so you can see what is set

# waits silently for a letter. This never affects `:marks`, which
# always shows the overlay.

channels = ["eng-general:1", "eng-alerts:2", "eng-*"]

## Section resolution

When `use_slack_sections = true` (the default) and Slack's section endpoint
is reachable, slk reads the user's actual sidebar sections — names, emoji,
linked-list order, and channel membership — directly from Slack and keeps
them live via WebSocket events. Any `[sections.*]` or
`[workspaces.<slug>.sections.*]` blocks in `config.toml` are ignored in this
mode (a one-line info note is emitted to the debug log on first connect so
the shadowing isn't silent). Set `use_slack_sections = false` globally, or
per-workspace, to opt into glob-based sections instead.

Per-workspace `[workspaces.<slug>.sections.*]` blocks fully replace the
global `[sections.*]` for that workspace. Workspaces that define no
sections of their own fall back to the global table.

### Ordering channels within a section

Each entry in a section's `channels` list may carry an optional `:<N>`
suffix where `N` is a non-negative integer. Channels matched by an
annotated pattern sort ahead of channels matched by un-annotated
patterns; among annotated channels, lower `N` wins; un-annotated
channels keep the order Slack returned them in.

```toml
[sections.Engineering]
channels = ["eng-general:1", "eng-alerts:2", "eng-*"]
order = 2
```

In the example above, `#eng-general` is pinned to the top of the
Engineering section, followed by `#eng-alerts`, followed by every
other `eng-*` channel in Slack-API order.

This syntax is only honored when `use_slack_sections = false` (or
when Slack's section endpoint is unreachable and slk falls back to
glob mode). In Slack-native mode, channel order within a section
comes from Slack and the `:<N>` suffix is ignored along with the
rest of the `[sections.*]` block.

### Limitations of Slack-native sections

Slack-native sections are read-only — section editing still happens in the official client; slk
reflects the results. The `stars` section type (Slack's "Starred" feature) is rendered
when non-empty, with the header `Starred`. Sections of type `slack_connect`,
`salesforce_records`, and `agents` are hidden. Sections with more than 10 channels may be returned
only partially by Slack's API on initial load; the missing channels
temporarily fall into the catch-all bucket and migrate into their correct
section as WebSocket events fire or the workspace reconnects. A debug-log
warning identifies which sections were truncated.

## Workspace order

The `order` field controls workspace position in the rail and the mapping
for the `1`–`9` digit keys. Positive values sort ascending (lowest first);
workspaces without an `order` (or with `order = 0`) sort after explicitly
ordered ones, alphabetically by slug. Tokens on disk that have no
`[workspaces.<slug>]` block at all sort last, alphabetically by team ID.
The order is stable across runs. Previously the rail order depended on
which workspace's WebSocket connected first; it is now deterministic
regardless of network timing, even without an explicit `order` set.

Legacy configs that key the block by raw team ID
(`[workspaces.T01ABCDEF]`) keep working unchanged.

## Terminal-palette themes (`ANSI Dark`, `ANSI Light`)

Two built-in themes use ANSI 16 color codes exclusively rather than
fixed RGB values. They inherit the user's terminal color palette, so
changing your terminal colorscheme (light/dark, solarized,
accessibility palettes, etc.) immediately changes slk's UI colors to
match.

```toml
[appearance]
theme = "ANSI Dark"   # or "ANSI Light"
```

Pick the variant whose background matches your terminal's background.

**Trade-off:** selection-row highlights and compose-input tints are
still computed as RGB approximations, so the tint regions of those
elements use truecolor rather than your palette. The rest of the UI
honors the palette.

## Custom themes

Drop `.toml` files into `~/.config/slk/themes/`:

```toml
name = "My Theme"

[colors]
primary      = "#BD93F9"
accent       = "#50FA7B"
warning      = "#FFB86C"
error        = "#FF5555"
background   = "#282A36"
surface      = "#343746"
surface_dark = "#21222C"
text         = "#F8F8F2"
text_muted   = "#6272A4"
border       = "#44475A"

# Optional sidebar/rail overrides — lets you have a darker sidebar with a
# lighter message pane (Slack's default look). Fall back to
# background/text/text_muted/surface_dark when omitted.
sidebar_background = "#19171D"
sidebar_text       = "#D1D2D3"
sidebar_text_muted = "#9A9B9E"
rail_background    = "#19171D"
```

Every built-in theme now sets a channels-panel (sidebar) background that is
perceptibly distinct from the message pane. When writing a custom theme,
set `sidebar_background` to a clearly darker (or, on near-black themes, a
slightly lighter) shade than `background` for the same effect.

Switch themes live with `Ctrl+y`.

## Marks

`m` followed by a letter records the selected message; `'` followed by
that letter jumps back to it. A mark records the channel, the message,
and — when you are reading inside a thread — the thread and the reply,
so `'a` can put you back on one message in a 200-reply thread.

Case decides lifetime, as in vim:

| | |
|---|---|
| `ma` … `mz` | session marks, gone when slk exits |
| `mA` … `mZ` | persistent, stored in the local SQLite cache |

`persist_all = true` makes lowercase marks persist as well. Turning it
off later does not delete them — they stop loading, and come back if you
turn it on again.

`''` is the back-jump: it returns you to wherever you were before the
last jump, whether or not the jump changed channel. Pressing it again
returns you to the mark, so `''` toggles between two places.

Marks belong to the workspace they were set in. The same letter in two
workspaces is two independent marks, and jumping to a mark from another
workspace is refused rather than switching workspaces.

A mark whose message has since been deleted still opens its channel and
tells you the message was not found; the mark is kept either way. Marks
are only removed when you remove them, with `:delmarks` or `Backspace`
in the `:marks` overlay.
